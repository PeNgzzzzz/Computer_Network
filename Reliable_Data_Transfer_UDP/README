How to run:
Run the nEmulator first (e.g., on ubuntu2204-006.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca).
1. Make sure <receiver's network address>, <sender's network address> and port numbers are correct.
2. Add the permission to execute the program (e.g $ chmod a+x nEmulator).
3. Execute it (e.g., $ ./nEmulator 9991 ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9994 9993 ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9992 1 0.2 0).

Then run the receiver (e.g., on ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca).
1. Make sure <hostname for the network emulator> and port numbers are correct.
2. Add the permission to execute the source code (e.g $ chmod a+x receiver.py).
3. Execute it (e.g., $ python3 receiver.py ubuntu2204-006.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9993 9994 output.txt).

Finally run the sender (e.g., on ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca).
1. Make sure <host address of the network emulator> and port numbers are correct.
2. Make sure <name of the file to be transferred> exists.
3. Add the permission to execute the source code (e.g $ chmod a+x sender.py).
4. Execute it (e.g., $ python3 sender.py ubuntu2204-006.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca 9991 9992 50 input.txt).

Testing:
This program has been tested on my local machine (all of the nEmulator, receiver and sender are running on my local machine).
This program has been tested in the linux.student.cs environment (
    1. All of the nEmulator, receiver and sender are running on ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca. 
    2. The three programs run on separate machines
    (nEmulator on ubuntu2204-006.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca, 
    receiver on ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca,
    sender on ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca).
