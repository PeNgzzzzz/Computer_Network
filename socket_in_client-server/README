How to run:
Run the server first.
1. Make sure <storage_directory> exists.
2. Add the permission to execute the script (e.g $ chmod a+x server.sh).
3. Execute it (e.g $ ./server.sh <storage_directory>).

Then run the client.
1. Make sure <server address> <n_port> <command> are valid.
2. Make sure <filename> exists.
2. Add the permission to execute the script (e.g $ chmod a+x client.sh).
3. Execute it (e.g $ ./client.sh <server_address> <n_port> <command> <filename>).

Testing:
This program has been tested on my local machine (both the server and the client are running on my local machine).
This program has been tested in the linux.student.cs environment (
    1. Both the server and the client are running on ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca. 
    2. The server is running on ubuntu2204-002.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca while the client is running on ubuntu2204-004.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca
)
